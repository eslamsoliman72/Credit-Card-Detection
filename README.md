# Credit-Card-Detection
Detecting Credit Card Fraud In light of the increasing number of customers using credit 
cards, as well as their information in the bank system, the bank must provide a good 
protection system. 
After a lot of research, they found that there is no alternative to entering Machine learning 
into the security system. This is a large number of customers and their information, but the 
model has gone through many stages in order to reach what we want and these stages are now 
clear with us
The goal of the project Here is two sides of the same coin, that is, to provide protection for the 
bank as well as the customer.
 This is done by :
1. Protecting the customer from any fraud or hacking to preserve his data
 2. Protecting the bank from any losses in the event of any fraud
 3. Provides an exchange of trust between customers and the bank
 4. Increases the number of customers at the bank that uses the fraud against protection system
